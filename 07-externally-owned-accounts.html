<h1>7. Externally Owned Accounts</h1>

<h3>Address</h3>

<p>
  In part I, you learned that addresses are to a blockchain are like IPs are to the internet, but
  how are addresses related to keys?
</p>

<p>
  An address is a 20 byte long integer that gets calculated from the public key and it can look like 
  this:<br>
  <code>0xdd00Cc906B93419814443Bb913949d503B3DF3c4</code>
</p>

<p>
  The 0x usually indicates a hex number, and the length was chosen to allow for enough addresses in 
  the future while still being short enough for everyday usage.
</p>

<p>
  The public key gets hashed with Keccak256, and the first 20 bytes of this hash become the address
  for an externally owned account (EOA) controlled by the related key pair.
</p>

<pre>
  let privateKey

  do {
    privateKey = generateRandomInteger()
  } while(privateKey > 0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffefffffc2fn)

  const publicKey = generatePublicKey(privateKey)

  const address = keccak256(publicKey).toString().slice(0,20)
</pre>



<h2>Example: Spending Tokens</h2>

<p>
  Let's say you want to spend tokens from an address.
</p>
  
<p> 
  You tell the Ethereum network your intent, and it will send you a message that you need to sign
  with your private key. Since the address is created from your public key, and the public key is
  created from a private key, Ethereum knows if your signature belongs to that address. 
</p>

<p>
  When you create a signature and give Ethereum a public key to verify it, Ethereum can run the
  Keccak256 hash on your public key and compare it with the address.
</p>

<p>
  If the address doesn't match the public key, Ethereum doesn't care that your signature matches 
  your public key.
</p>

<p>
  If your public key matches the address, but the signature can't be verified with that public key,
  Ethereum concludes that you don't own that address.
