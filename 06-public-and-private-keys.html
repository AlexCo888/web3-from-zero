<title>Web3 From Zero - Lesson 6</title>

<h1>6. Public & Private Keys (DRAFT)</h1>

<p>
  I wanted to start part II of this course with wallets. Because a crypto wallet will be the 
  software, you need to install and set up for part II. But I thought the keys are only a 
  part of the things a wallet manages for you and the most important part. So, I think keys 
  deserve their own lesson.
</p>

<blockquote>
  This lesson won't go into the nitty-gritty details of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). As you can
  learn Web2 development with FreeCodeCamp; there are better resources to understand this topic.
  "Practical Cryptography for Developers" is a free ebook with
  <a href="https://cryptobook.nakov.com/asymmetric-key-ciphers/elliptic-curve-cryptography-ecc">
    a chapter that explains ECC
  </a> excellently.
</blockquote>

<h2>Security Considerations</h2>

<p>
  If I learned one thing about cryptography, it's that <b>you should never ever give away your
  private key</b>. If you don't understand anything from the book mentioned above or written in this
  chapter, at least keep that small piece of wisdom in mind.
</p>

<p>
  This means only ever write your private key in a secure wallet application and never in a text 
  file on your PC or smartphone. It's too long for the average human to memorize without
  much effort, so your best bet is to write it down on paper, so nobody with access to your 
  computers can read it from your filesystem.
</p>

<p>
  In some countries, you might fear that the government will be after your keys, but the more likely
  threat is your house burning down or water damage. So, make sure you have copies at different
  secure locations.
</p>

<p>
  Also, if you need a private key for development that you will hard-code in a source file for
  tests, make sure that you use a dedicated development key that's only used for this purpose,
  otherwise, your key could end up on GitHub, S3, etc.
</p>

<p>
  The same goes for your seed phrase, which is a way to represent a private key as a list of short 
  words. As a developer, you might interact with private keys directly, but most people usually use 
  their private key in the form of a seed phrase when they move it around between wallets and
  paper.
</p>

<p>
  It's also worth mentioning that <b>you shouldn't throw around your addresses and public keys
  mindlessly</b>. While nobody can directly steal your assets without your private key, an attacker
  can send tokens to your address for phishing purposes. These could lead you to some web apps that
  try to scam you into using your private key to do something dumb.
</p>

<h2>What are Keys?</h2>

<p>
  A key, private or public, is just some kind of information. In the specific case of ECC, these two 
  keys are massive numbers. So big that you usually end up storing them as <code>string</code> or
  <code>BigInteger</code>in JavaScript.

<h3>Private Key</h3>

<p>
  A private key for ECC is a randomly generated integer that can look something like this<br>
  <code>57cfa2d774eab59998a0b87d641b504aaefeae12f244db08d77e019e6d90afb9</code>
</p>
  
<p>
  In Ethereum and many other blockchain networks, this key must be smaller than a predefined prime number.
</p>

<p>
  This big number looks like this in hexadecimal: <br>
  <code>fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffefffffc2f</code><br>
  And like this in decimal: <br>
  <code>115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663</code>
</p>

<p>
  The reason for this specific number is out of the scope of this course, but you can read about
  it in the book I linked at the beginning of this lesson. But this limit is important because not
  every random integer is a valid private key, and if you want to generate your own, you have to
  stay under it.
</p>

<pre>
  let privateKey

  do {
    privateKey = generateRandomInteger()
  } while(privateKey > 0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffefffffc2fn)
</pre>

<h3>Public Key</h3>

<p>
  A public key for ECC consists of two integers that are concatenated together. Both of these
  integers can have the private key length, but they aren't random. These two numbers are
  calculated from the private key.
</p>

<p>
  A public key can look like this:<br>
  <code>0453a07319d6d7a34d1bf3363415a316c0f5cd4cb5fe49f414b1c9d7b420169b652cf466ed56ec01733a9726ee27017ad66e384eefc2d6897aa61d3157cc1273eb</code>
</p>

<p>
  The function used to calculate a public key from a private key is based on a specific
  algorithm and some predefined parameters. All systems interacting with the Ethereum network have
  to use the same algorithm and parameters to get the same results.
</p>

<pre>
  let privateKey

  do {
    privateKey = generateRandomInteger()
  } while(privateKey > 0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffefffffc2fn)

  const publicKey = generatePublicKey(privateKey)
</pre>


<h3>Address</h3>

<p>
  In part I, you learned that addresses are to a blockchain are like IPs are to the internet, but
  how are addresses related to keys?
</p>

<p>
  An address is a 20 byte long integer that gets calculated from the public key and it can look like 
  this:<br>
  <code>0xdd00Cc906B93419814443Bb913949d503B3DF3c4</code>
</p>

<p>
  The 0x usually indicates a hex number, and the length was chosen to allow for enough addresses in 
  the future while still being short enough for everyday usage.
</p>

<p>
  The public key gets hashed with Keccak256, and the first 20 bytes of this hash become the address
  for an externally owned account (EOA) controlled by the related key pair.
</p>

<pre>
  let privateKey

  do {
    privateKey = generateRandomInteger()
  } while(privateKey > 0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffefffffc2fn)

  const publicKey = generatePublicKey(privateKey)

  const address = keccak256(publicKey).toString().slice(0,20)
</pre>

<h3>Seed Phrase</h3>

<p>
  A seed phrase, also known as a secret recovery phrase, is a list of 12-24 short random words used to generate one or more private keys and, in turn, public keys and addresses in the end.
</p>

<p>
  A seed phrase could look like this:<br>
  <code>forget wing follow flip swallow achieve correct view dinner witness hybrid proud</code>
</p>

<p>
  While you can generate a private key directly, many wallet applications use a seed phrase to 
  generate them for you. Many people use multiple addresses, and if you're developing with Ethereum
  and using it for day-to-day things, you will at least need two addresses and, in turn, private
  keys.
</p>

<p>
  The idea is that not every private key is random, but only the seed phrase they are generated
  from. This allows to generate multiple keys from one phrase and, in turn, recover all these keys 
  from the seed phrase. Otherwise, you would have to write down every private key you used on its
  own. 
</p>

<pre>
  const seedPhrase = [
    "forget", "wing", "follow",
    "flip", "swallow", "achieve",
    "correct", "view", "dinner",
    "witness", "hybrid", "proud"
  ]

  const keyGenerator = initKeyGenerator(seedPhrase)
  
  const keys = []
  for(let i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    const privateKey = keyGenerator(i)
    const publicKey = generatePublicKey(privateKey)
    const address = keccak256(publicKey).toString().slice(0,20)
    keys.push({ privateKey, publicKey, address})
  }
</pre>
<br>

<p>
  The downside of this is that if your seed phrase gets stolen, all addresses generated from it are 
  compromised. This means everything true for your private key is also true ten-fold for
  your seed phrase because it essentially represents multiple private keys.
</p>
  
<p><b>Never write your seed phrase down on your PC or smartphone outside of your wallet apps, never
  store it in an S3 bucket, or GitHub, etc.</b> To recover your keys when you lose your devices, or
  they break, you can write the seed phrase on a piece of paper and store it in a secure location.
</p>

<h2>What are the Keys Used for?</h2>

<p>
  So, you know what the keys are and how you should handle them, but what exactly is their purpose?
</p>

<p>
  The private and public keys are used for different tasks. Their usage follows from the fact that
  everyone can potentially have your public keys, and no one should ever have your private key.
</p>

<p>
  The private key is used mainly to sign data. Signing means you attach a signature to the data. 
  A signature is created with a signature algorithm that uses your private key and the data that
  needs to be signed.
</p>

<p>
  A signature could look like this in its Base64 version:<br>
  <code>MEQCIEamErEp0wjW2nBCwPJyMWB1UEb8UHaEFeUDko88MOs/AiB5daIS5j1stXRetBsEWbvd0TeoYsfucmADmxFUxbE2oQ==</code>
</p>


<p>
  The public key is used to verify that signature. If you sign something with a private key, the 
  related public key, in combination with the signing algorithm, the signature, and the signed data,
  will either lead to a "yes, this signature is from the correct private key" or not.
</p>

<p>
  Since you are the only one who should have your private keys, you are the only one who can create 
  these signatures. If it gets stolen, other people can pretend they are the original owners (i. e. 
  you). If you lose your private key, you can't create correct signatures anymore, and systems 
  with your public key won't believe that you are indeed who you pretend to be.

<h2>Example: Spending Tokens</h2>

<p>
  Let's say you want to spend tokens from an address.
</p>
  
<p> 
  You tell the Ethereum network your intent, and it will send you a message that you need to sign
  with your private key. Since the address is created from your public key, and the public key is
  created from a private key, Ethereum knows if your signature belongs to that address. 
</p>

<p>
  When you create a signature and give Ethereum a public key to verify it, Ethereum can run the
  Keccak256 hash on your public key and compare it with the address.
</p>

<p>
  If the address doesn't match the public key, Ethereum doesn't care that your signature matches 
  your public key.
</p>

<p>
  If your public key matches the address, but the signature can't be verified with that public key,
  Ethereum concludes that you don't own that address.
</p>
