<title>Web3 From Zero - Lesson 0</title>

<h1>0. Connecting to a Blockchain Network</h1>

<p>
This tutorial will start from zero, which means that the first lessons don't require you to install
anything. You don't need a wallet or dev environment; you just need your browser and basic
JavaScript skills.
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> If you don't have JavaScript skills yet, because you're just started your developer 
journey, or because you come from a different programming language, I'd recommend 
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">FreeCodeCamp</a>. They offer hundreds of hours of 
JavaScript courses for beginners for free!

<h2>Connection Modes</h2>

<p>
Coming from Web2, you probably know how to load your data from storage into a frontend. You connect
to a backend via an HTTP API, and this API, in turn, loads data from storage like a database.
</p>

<p>
The same is true for Web3. If you don't have a crypto wallet, you need an HTTP API to connect to a
blockchain network. This API is called a gateway. It accepts requests from a browser via HTTP and
routes them to a blockchain network. You can only read data from the blockchain with this connection
mode.
</p>

<p>
If you have a crypto wallet, you can make it accessible with a browser extension for a frontend. In
the case of Ethereum, such an extension will inject a global <code>ethereum</code> object into your
frontend that you can use to interact with your wallet. You can use this connection mode to read and
write blockchain data, like sending transactions.
</p>

<p>
If you have a wallet installed and the extension set up, it will connect to the blockchain network 
via an HTTP gateway, so the browser doesn't have to interact with the gateway directly.
</p>

<p>
In Figure 1, you can see the different types of connectionsâ€”Web2 and Web3 with and without a wallet.

<p>
In this tutorial, you will start with the read-only connection mode. You don't have to install
anything for the first few lessons!
</p>

<h2>Using Ethers.js</h2>

<p>
<a href="https://docs.ethers.io/v5/">Ethers.js</a> is a library that helps with connecting to the
Ethereum network. When using Ethers.js, you don't have to care if you connect directly via an HTTP
gateway or use a wallet extension. After you establish a connection, you can call the same
functions.
</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows how Ethers.js fits between your frontend and the Ethereum network.</p>

<p>
Ethers.js comes in the form of an ES-module on the NPM package registry. This means, you can
<code>import</code> it directly in the browser from <a href="https://unpkg.com/">the Unpkg CDN</a>.
</p>

<p>Listing 1 shows how you <code>import</code> the <code>ethers</code> package into your code.</p>

<pre>import {ethers} from "//unpkg.com/ethers@5.5.1/dist/ethers.esm.min.js"</pre>
<cite>Listing 1: Importing the Ethers.js package</cite> 

<h2>Connecting to the Ethereum Network</h2>

<p>
To connect to the Ethereum network, you have to create a provider. Providers are the abstraction
Ethers.js uses to normalize access via wallet and HTTP gateway.
</p>

<p>
You can create such an provider by calling the <code>getDefaultProvider</code> method of the
<code>ethers</code> object you imported before. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> This tutorial features an interactive editor. Here you can write JavaScript code and
execute it with the press of a button. The Ethers.js library is imported for you and you can us
<code>await</code> for asynchronous requests. It also has a <code>print</code> function you can use
for debugging.
</blockquote>

<p>
The first example is already complete to show you how things work. Just press the <b>Execute</b>
button and check the result.
</p>

<code-editor>
const provider = ethers.getDefaultProvider()
print(provider)
</code-editor>

<p>
Let's try it yourself!
</p>

<p>
To read data from the Etherum network, you can call the <code>getBlock</code> method of the
<code>ethers</code> object. It returns a promise that resolves to an object that contains the
block's data, so you need to <code>await</code> it. After you got the block, you can display its 
content with the <code>print</code> function.
</p>

<code-editor>
const provider = ethers.getDefaultProvider()
// Write your code here!
<p>
const block = await provider.getBlock()
print(block)
</p>
</code-editor>

<p>
If everything went correctly, you see the block data in the results. This data is all
blockchain-specific information that doesn't tell us anything interesting yet. At least, you see
that the connection worked and something came back!
</p>

<p>
The Ethers.js library comes pre-configured with a public HTTP gateway you can use for free to read
data from the Ethereum blockchain. This gateway has a request frequency limit, so it can happen that
you don't get a response if you send too many requests. But for this tutorial, it should be enough.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
In this lesson, you learned the differences between a Web2 and a Web3 backend. How both rely on HTTP
APIs. We call these APIs gateways in Web3 because they are the gateway into the blockchain network.
</p>

<p>
You also learned how to connect to such a blockchain network with the help of the Ethers.js library.
You didn't have to install anything, just call a few methods and see what happens.
